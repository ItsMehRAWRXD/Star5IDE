# Analysis of Suspicious PHP Code

## Warning: This is malicious code!

### What this code does:

1. **Obfuscation Technique**: The code uses multiple layers of obfuscation:
   - Base64 encoding
   - Gzip compression
   - Dynamic evaluation with `@eval()`

2. **Red Flags**:
   - `@error_reporting(0)` - Suppresses all errors
   - `@set_time_limit(0)` - Removes execution time limit
   - `@eval()` - Executes hidden code with error suppression
   - Comment claims "no malware" but uses classic malware obfuscation

3. **Header Analysis**:
   - Sets up a file download for "own.php"
   - Content-type: application/octet-stream
   - This suggests it might be a web shell or backdoor

## DO NOT RUN THIS CODE!

This appears to be:
- A PHP web shell/backdoor
- Possibly a file manager or remote access tool
- Designed to give attackers control over the server

## What to do:

1. **If this is on your server**:
   - Remove it immediately
   - Check server logs for unauthorized access
   - Look for other suspicious files
   - Change all passwords
   - Update all software
   - Consider professional security audit

2. **Check for indicators of compromise**:
   - Look for files named "own.php" or similar
   - Check for recently modified PHP files
   - Review access logs for suspicious activity
   - Scan for other backdoors

3. **Prevention**:
   - Keep software updated
   - Use strong passwords
   - Implement file integrity monitoring
   - Regular security scans
   - Proper file permissions

## Safe Decoding (without execution)

To safely see what's hidden without executing, you could:
```php
// DO NOT use eval!
$decoded = base64_decode($code);
$inflated = gzinflate($decoded);
// Write to file for analysis, don't execute
file_put_contents('decoded_malware.txt', $inflated);
```

But even this should be done in an isolated environment!
